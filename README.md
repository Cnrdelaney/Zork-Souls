# Zork-Souls
Game created during internship for fun


Note that the starting values for gold and health are completely relative to the difficulty you prefer :)

Simply change the numbers in the gamestate dictionary at the top of the code


Shoutout to Peter Gibb for working on this with me and Preston Epps for the Blackjack section
