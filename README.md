# Zork-Souls
Game created during internship for fun


Note that in order to play this you need a python interpretor on the terminal and it is currently only compatible with Ubuntu/Linux systems. To switch to windows, all instances of ' raw_input ' must be replaced with ' input ' and ' os.system('clear') ' with ' os.system('clr') '  . Good luck!


Shoutout to Peter Gibb for working on this with me and Preston Epps for the Blackjack section
